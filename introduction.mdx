## What is Proficient AI?

Proficient AI is a platform that enables developers to add conversational AI agents to their apps in minutes.
Our interaction APIs and SDKs coupled with our powerful web dashboard are the simplest way teams can
add and operate AI agents for their end-user applications.

## How it works

Our intuitive and easy-to-use platform has everything you need to make the integration process a breeze.

### Steps

Here are all the steps required for an end-to-end integration of an AI agent:

1. Go to the [web dashboard](https://proficientai.com) and create an agent with the specified AI provider
2. Customize the agent to your application's needs by editing its configuration
3. Add the prebuilt UI component to your app to connect it to the agent (3-5 lines of code)

Done! The agent appears in a chat window with a persistent conversation history and your users
are ready to interact with it, once you deploy.

<Tip>
  For more advanced features, you need to use the API, which lets you connect
  your agents to all parts of your application.

### Architecture

We can visualize the architecture of a typical application powered by Proficient AI with the following diagram.

There are a few key things to note here:

- **Agents live in Proficient cloud**

  Agents are virtual entitites that you operate through the Proficient platform.

- **Agents can be connected to many different models**

  Proficient is connected to many different LLM providers so you don't have to write your own integration.

- **Your frontend can securely connect to Proficient**

  For simple use cases, your app may not even need a custom backend.

- **Your backend can connect to Proficient**

  You can use the API to programmatically manage your agents and update user data.

- **Proficient stores interactions and user data**

  You can access your data at any time using the API or admin dashboard.

### Two separate APIs

All operations on the Proficient platform are divided into two categories each of which is represented by
a standalone API.

#### 1. Client API

The [Client API](/client-api-reference) is designed for client applications that are allowed to access only
a subset of all available operations. For example, agents can't be configured from a client application. On
the other hand, an authenticated user sending a message to an agent can be implemented with the Client API.

#### 2. Admin API

The [Admin API](/admin-api-reference) is used in privileged environments like your server. With admin-level
access, you can use this API to create, configure and delete agents, monitor interactions, update user data
and more.

<Info>The Admin API should not be accessed from client applications.</Info>
