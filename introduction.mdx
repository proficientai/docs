## What is Proficient?

Proficient AI is a platform that enables developers to add conversational AI agents to their apps in minutes.
Our interaction APIs and SDKs coupled with our powerful web dashboard are the simplest way teams can
add and operate AI assistants for their end-user applications.

## How does it work?

Here are all the steps required for an end-to-end integration of an AI agent:

1. Go to the [web dashboard](https://proficientai.com) and create an agent with the specified AI provider
2. Configure the agent to your application's needs
3. Add the prebuilt UI component to your app to connect it to the agent (3-5 lines of code)

Done! The agent appears in a chat window with a persistent conversation history and your users
are ready to interact with it, once you deploy.

## What can I build with it?

- Virtual tutors
- AI assistants for internal tooling
- General-purpose chatbots
