## What is Proficient AI?

Proficient AI is a platform that enables developers to add conversational AI agents to their apps
in minutes. Our interaction APIs and SDKs coupled with our powerful web dashboard are the simplest
way teams can add and operate AI agents for their end-user applications.

## How it works

Here is a simple overview of the steps to get started:

1. Go to the [web dashboard](https://proficientai.com) and create an agent with the specified AI provider
2. Customize the agent to your application's needs by editing its configuration
3. Add the prebuilt UI component to your app to connect it to the agent (3-5 lines of code)

Done! The agent appears in a chat window with a persistent conversation history and your users
are ready to interact with it, once you deploy.

<Tip>
  For more advanced features, you need to use the API, which lets you connect
  your agents to all parts of your application.

## Architecture

We can visualize the architecture of a typical application powered by Proficient AI with the following diagram.

  Proficient is connected to many different models so you don't have to write
  your own integration.

## Proficient APIs

All operations on the Proficient platform are divided into two categories each of which is represented by
a standalone API.

### 1. Client API

The [Client API](/client-api) is designed for client applications that are allowed to access only
a subset of all available operations. For example, agents can't be configured from a client application. On
the other hand, an authenticated user sending a message to an agent can be implemented with the Client API.

  client applications.

### 2. Admin API

The [Admin API](/admin-api) is used by backend applications. With admin-level
access, you can use this API to create, configure and delete agents, monitor interactions, update user data
and more.
