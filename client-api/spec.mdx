Our Client API specification is defined in [Fern](https://buildwithfern.com), which is
[a more powerful alternative](https://buildwithfern.com/docs/comparison-with-openapi) to OpenAPI.
Fern definition allows us to produce fully type-safe code and brings a higher level of
reliability to our systems. We also have an OpenAPI spec, which is generated by Fern.
