Authentication with the Client API is achieved with three request headers, one of which is optional depending on your project configuration.

## Headers

<ParamField query="X-PROFICIENT-API-KEY" type="string" required>
  The publishable API key associated with your project. You can find this in the
  admin dashboard. It's a string that starts with `pk_`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="X-PROFICIENT-USER-EXTERNAL-ID" type="string" required>
  A string that uniquely identifies the user within your project. Ensure that
  this is the ID that you use to identify the user in your system e.g. database
  ID, Firebase Auth ID etc. Failing to do so may cause unexpected bugs and
  errors in your application.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="X-PROFICIENT-USER-HMAC" type="string" optional>
  The HMAC hash for the user. See [HMAC Authentication](#hmac-authentication)
  for more details.
</ParamField>

Here is an example cURL request containing two auth headers:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.proficientai.com/interactions \
  --header 'X-PROFICIENT-API-KEY: pk_40NDqyJqjBe6DJyLn44HBEgi0loTunwLdjWHhcOUGONSkpomQx0qInkWLtu0ouwSr6qqE7HQ' \
  --header 'X-PROFICIENT-USER-EXTERNAL-ID: gtLIK8ELsHTr0Fajg28Ud9eFpJJ3'
```

</CodeGroup>

## HMAC Authentication

HMAC authentication is a mechanism that provides an additional layer of security to ensure your client
application can securely consume Proficient APIs. To enable HMAC authentication for a given project you
simply need to go the [Project Settings](https://proficientai.com/project-settings) page on the dashboard
and toggle it on.

Once HMAC authentication is enabled, all Client API endpoints will require a `X-PROFICIENT-USER-HMAC`
header, and the requests that don't include will be rejected with a `401` error.

<Warning>
  While HMAC authentication is optional, we strongly recommend enabling it for
  applications that have an authentication flow where user data is persisted
  into your system. Disabling HMAC may pose a security risk where an end user
  can access another user's data.
</Warning>

### Computing the HMAC hash

The HMAC hash is a string generated with the [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) algorithm using your project's HMAC secret as key and
your user's external ID. You can find the HMAC secret associated with your project in [Project Settings](https://proficientai.com/project-settings).
It's a string that starts with `hsec_`.

The HMAC hash needs to computed in your backend for each user. You can set up a small backend service
(e.g. a Firebase Cloud Function or AWS Lambda) where you authenticate the user and then proceed to
compute the hash with their unique ID.

<Info>

Summarizing the entire flow:

1. Your frontend sends a request to your backend with the user's external ID.
2. Your backend authenticates the request using your authentication system.
3. Your backend computes the hash and sends it back to your frontend.
4. Your frontend can now access Proficient's Client API with the `X-PROFICIENT-USER-HMAC` header.
